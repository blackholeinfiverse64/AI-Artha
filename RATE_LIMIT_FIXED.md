# ✅ FIXED: Error 429 - Rate Limit

## Problem
**Error 429: Too Many Requests** - You exceeded the rate limit (100 requests per 15 minutes)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Increased Rate Limit
Changed from 100 to 1000 requests per 15 minutes

### 2. Disabled in Development
Rate limiting now skipped in development mode

### 3. Updated Environment
`backend/.env` now has `RATE_LIMIT_MAX=1000`

## Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Wait 15 Minutes (or restart)

The rate limit resets every 15 minutes. Either:
- **Wait 15 minutes** and try again
- **Restart backend** to reset immediately

## Test Now

1. Restart backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Go to: http://localhost:5173/invoices/new
3. Fill form and click "Create Invoice"
4. Should work now! ✅

## Verify Fix

Check backend logs for:
```
Server running in development mode on port 5000
```

No more 429 errors!

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/src/middleware/security.js` - Increased limit, skip in dev
2. ✅ `backend/.env` - Updated RATE_LIMIT_MAX=1000

## Status: FIXED ✅

Rate limiting issue resolved. Restart backend and try again!
