# REVIEW_PACKET.md

**Project:** ARTHA v0.1 — BHIV Ecosystem Integration
**Date:** July 2026
**Status:** Production Ready
**Reviewer:** [Your Name]

---

## Executive Summary

This review packet demonstrates that the ARTHA accounting system has been successfully transitioned from a production-ready bridge into a fully operational BHIV ecosystem participant. The implementation covers runtime convergence, TANTRA integration, production validation, security/adversarial testing, and complete documentation.

---

## Phase 1: Runtime Convergence — COMPLETED

### What Was Done
1. **Canonical Capability Registry** (`capabilityRegistry.service.js`)
   - Single source of truth for all capability contracts
   - Loads from `contracts/capability_contracts/*.json`
   - Provides runtime queries: `resolveRoute()`, `canMutateCollection()`, `validateInput()`
   - Contract hash verification for tamper detection

2. **Policy Engine Middleware** (`policyEngine.js`)
   - Runtime enforcement of capability boundaries
   - Deterministic policy decisions (ALLOW/DENY)
   - Policy decision recording for audit
   - Collection mutation authorization
   - Input schema validation

3. **Capability Contract Updates**
   - All 9 contracts verified and loaded at startup
   - Route-to-capability mapping validated
   - No duplicate runtime configuration

### Evidence
- All capability contracts loaded successfully
- Policy engine middleware mounted and enforcing
- No configuration duplication

---

## Phase 2: TANTRA Integration — COMPLETED

### What Was Done
1. **TANTRA Runtime Registration**
   - Bridge registered as governed runtime participant
   - Execution contracts integrated
   - Authority boundaries validated

2. **Immutable Provenance Chain** (`provenanceChain.service.js`)
   - Append-only, hash-linked governance decisions
   - Genesis block initialization
   - Chain integrity verification
   - Records: capability decisions, policy events, contract verification, deployments, adversarial attempts

3. **Deterministic Replay System** (`deterministicReplay.service.js`)
   - Records execution inputs/outputs with deterministic hashes
   - Replay data retrieval for independent verification
   - Replay proof generation
   - SHA-256 hash comparison for determinism verification

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** (`circuitBreaker.service.js`)
   - State machine: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN
   - 6 registered breakers: mongodb, redis, setu_api, tantra_runtime, ocr_service, evidence_pipeline
   - Configurable thresholds and recovery times

### Evidence
- Provenance chain initialized with genesis block
- Replay system recording executions
- Circuit breakers registered and monitoring

---

## Phase 3: Production Validation — COMPLETED

### What Was Done
1. **Independent Verification Engine** (`independentVerifier.service.js`)
   - 10 verification tests:
     - Capability contract verification
     - Authority boundary verification
     - Hash chain integrity
     - Double-entry balancing
     - Trace continuity
     - Circuit breaker status
     - Contract integrity
     - Route mapping
     - Policy enforcement
     - Adversarial resistance
   - Independently reproducible evidence

2. **Deployment Evidence Generator** (`deploymentEvidence.service.js`)
   - Evidence types: clean deployment, fresh install, runtime startup, health verification, failover recovery, contract enforcement, authority rejection, adversarial attempts, replay verification
   - Content hash for tamper detection
   - Manifest generation

3. **Adversarial Test Suite** (`adversarialSuite.service.js`)
   - 12 genuine adversarial tests:
     - Unmapped route access
     - Read-only violation
     - Invalid capability ID
     - Contract tampering
     - Forged capability ID
     - Invalid authority request
     - Configuration tampering
     - Duplicate execution
     - Broken provenance
     - Dependency failure
     - JWT replay
     - Input injection
   - All tests produce deterministic evidence

### Evidence
- Verification suite: PASS
- Adversarial suite: PASS (all 12 attacks blocked)
- Deployment evidence captured
